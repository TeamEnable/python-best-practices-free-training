# Python Best Practices — Free Mini‑Training (Linux + uv first)

Short, practical lessons you can follow on a **fresh Linux box**. Each lesson has:
- a **mini text** (copy‑paste ready commands + the “why” in one line), and
- an optional **video** (Loom/YouTube) link.

> This free resource is part of our broader training in **Skool**. Join the community and follow the full curriculum: **[Join the Skool →](https://example.com/skool)**

## Who is this for?
- Developers who want a **clean Python workflow** without touching system Python.
- Folks who prefer **fast, reproducible, CLI‑first** practices.
- Trainers who want a lightweight, remixable curriculum.

## Quick start

# clone
git clone https://github.com/you/python-best-practices-free-training.git

# (optional) run pre-commit hooks locally

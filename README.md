# Python Best Practices — Free Mini‑Training (Linux + uv first)

Short, practical lessons you can follow on a **fresh Linux box** (also adaptable to macOS). Each lesson has:
- a **mini text** (copy‑paste ready commands + the “why” in one line), and
- an optional **video** (Loom/YouTube) link.

> This free resource is part of our broader training in **Skool**. Join the community and follow the full curriculum: **[Join the Skool →](https://www.skool.com/onboard-or-join-a-tech-team-1664/about?ref=b3e6a8e94d23403f95fbc99110cb48e3)**

## Who is this for?
- Developers who want a **clean Python workflow** without touching system Python.
- Folks who prefer **fast, reproducible, CLI‑first** practices.
- Trainers who want a lightweight, remixable curriculum.
